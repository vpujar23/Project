                  My name is Vijayalaxmi Pujar and I use she/her pronouns. I am
                  currently pursuing my masters in computer science at Portland
                  state university. Regarding my work experience, I worked 6+
                  years as a Software quality assurance engineer. I worked
                  mainly for two major clients Southwest airlines and Navigators
                  marine insurance. Have expertise in Insurance as well as
                  Airline domain. Worked in various teams such as automation and
                  performance testing. Now as a part of MS program ,I am trying
                  to improve skill sets in Database , AI/ML fields and figuring
                  out my interests in these fields. As of now ,I am more
                  inclined towards AI/ML. Hopefully ,I will find a path to my
                  new beginnings until I reach end of MS program. Excited for my
                  new career and explore the development side of technology.
